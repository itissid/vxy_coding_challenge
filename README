gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:4999 app:wordcount

To run only on local server to debug:
```
>> export FLASK_DEBUG=1
>> flask run
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 313-665-416
```
Don't use above method in prod. The advantage of the above is a 
webapp that reloads with changes. Makes dev faster
