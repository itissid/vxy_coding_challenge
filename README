## Installation
1. Install the python dependencies from requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install bower. See https://bower.io/
3. Install the requisite bower components from `bower.json` using `bower install`
4. Run the flask server using gunicorn
`gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:4999 app:wordcount`

To run only on local server to debug and develop:

```
>> export FLASK_DEBUG=1
>> export FLASK_APP=app:wordcount
>> flask run
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 313-665-416
```
Don't use local server in prod. The advantage of the above is a 
webapp that reloads with changes. Makes dev faster.
